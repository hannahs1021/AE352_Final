“The model, as determined through its parameters such as mass, power consumption, engine torques, and rotor blade size, shall be realistic and implementable, preferably through the use of off-the-shelf parts. In particular, the mass of the drone shall be between 0.1kg and 10kg.”

Q4105 Small Four-axis:
Net weight: 5.4 kg
Power system: 180KV motor + 80A ESC
Battery life is 6-20 hours
Idk how to find engine torque??
Propeller blade size: 24 inches
Hover 1m above ground for 2 minutes. (can for 42 minutes)
Fly in a circle of radius 2m, at an altitude of 1m above ground, at a speed of 0.5m/s for at least 1 minute. (max speed is 20, so I wanna assume yes?)
Launch from the ground and ascend vertically until 1m above ground. Move in a straight line 1m above ground at an average speed of 1m/s for 5m, stop (hover), yaw 90 deg to the left, move in another straight line for 5m, stop (hover), land vertically with a speed of no more than 1cm/s. (max descent speed is 8 m/s)
I’m gonna assume it can do the other stuff cause it’s a drone

Potensic Atom 2:
Net weight: .245 kg lol
Power system: smart battery DSBT02B
Don’t know the battery life, the remote is 4 hours, so I'm gonna assume that
Convinced engine torque isn’t a thing
Propeller blade size: 119.4×63.8 mm HAHHAHA (diameter x thread pitch)
Hover 1m above ground for 2 minutes. (can for 29 minutes)
Fly in a circle of radius 2m, at an altitude of 1m above ground, at a speed of 0.5m/s for at least 1 minute. (max speed is 10, so I wanna assume yes?)
Launch from the ground and ascend vertically until 1m above ground. Move in a straight line 1m above ground at an average speed of 1m/s for 5m, stop (hover), yaw 90 deg to the left, move in another straight line for 5m, stop (hover), land vertically with a speed of no more than 1cm/s. (max descent speed is  4 m/s) (mechanical range: Tilt: -125° to +45° Roll: ±45° Pan: ±30°)

DJi mini SE drone:
Net weight: .246 kg
Power system: capacity is 2250 mAh, and it’s a Li-ion battery 
Battery life is 4-6 hours
Engine torque? Who’s she

Launch from the ground and ascend vertically until 1m above ground. Move in a straight line 1m above ground at an average speed of 1m/s for 5m, stop (hover), yaw 90 deg to the left, move in another straight line for 5m, stop (hover), land vertically with a speed of no more than 1cm/s. (max descent speed is 3.5 m/s)(mechanical range: Tilt: -110° to 35°, Roll: -35° to 35 °, Pan: -20° to 20°)
